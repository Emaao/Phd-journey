# Phd-journey
My PhD learning &amp; research journey : papers, Learning, experiments, insights..
I created this repository for two main goals:
- To keep track of everything I'm doing since I just started 3 week sago I want to keep everything structured and organized
- Also, to look back someday and realize what I've done during my PhD journey.

I hope this will help me achieve eveyrthing I want 
I'm ambitious and curious but consistency and discipline are the keys.

Good luck!!
