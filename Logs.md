I started my PhD three weeks ago; Starting to log my progress from today.

- Created another one to log quotes from paper I know I would need someday that are related to my topic
- Added VOSviewer to get a more big image about what I'm doing
- Understood "Detecting Attacks at Switching Speed: AI/ML and Active  Learning for in-Network Monitoring in Data Planes" paper and added to the excel file
