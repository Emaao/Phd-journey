## Method
This paper Introduces HALIDS a hybrid IDS that focuses in two parts of detections:
  In-switch ML learning model who is fast but simple
  Oracle ML model who is more powerful for better detection in case of a low confidence level

## Limitations
  No distributed learning
  No deep complex attacks
  only one controller
  No mitigation

## My thoughts
  Maybe combine with federated learning and distributing the work across switches 
  Maybe aslo use a more heavy model in the oracle controller
  Do mitigation 
  Base the confidence depending on how heavy or busy the network
